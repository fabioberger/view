// Package view is a small library for organizing view-related code written in pure go
// which compiles to javascript via gopherjs (https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs). View
// includes a View interface and some helper functions for operating on views (e.g. Append,
// Replace, Remove, etc.). Router works great as a stand-alone package or in combintation
// with other packages in the Humble Framework (https://github.com/go-humble/humble).
//
// Version 0.1.0
